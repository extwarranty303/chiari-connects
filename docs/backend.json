    "reasoning": "The Firestore data structure is designed to ensure security, scalability, and ease of debugging, in accordance with the defined principles.  Authorization Independence is achieved by leveraging path-based ownership for private user data and avoiding `get()` calls in security rules. Structural Segregation is applied by storing user-specific data under `/users/{userId}`. Access Modeling uses path-based ownership for the `User -> Project -> CodeFile -> AISuggestion` hierarchy and the new `User -> Symptom` hierarchy. This ensures that a user's symptom data is private and only accessible by them.\n\nThe structure supports required QAPs by ensuring that list operations can be securely performed based on path-based ownership. For example, listing projects is done under `/users/{userId}/projects`, and listing symptoms is done under `/users/{userId}/symptoms`, allowing a simple rule to check if `request.auth.uid == userId` for listing data owned by a user."
